# Lab Sets
## Lab Set 1

**Description:** Lab Set 1 tackles a population problem, how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size.

**Contents:**

1. **Files:** `population.c`

2. **Description:** This lab set sees the creation of a population model where each year, one-third of the llamas are born, and one-fourth of them pass away from the initial population.

3. **Approach:** My code uses user input to simulate population growth, calculating the number of years it takes to reach a specified population size (m). It employs a loop to update the population each year, considering births and deaths, and then prints the number of years once the target population is reached.

4. **Code:** You can find the complete code for each task in their respective files.

5. **Testing:** I tested the code with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.

## Lab Set 1

**Description:** Lab Set 2 creates a scrabble game that determines which of two scrabble words is worth more

**Contents:**

1. **Files:** `scrabble.c`

2. **Description:** This lab set implements a simple word game where two players input words, and the program calculates their scores based on the letters in those words and determines the winner.

3. **Approach:** I implemented a `compute_score` function to calculate the word scores and then compared the scores to determine the winner between Player 1 and Player 2. The winner or a tie is printed accordingly.

4. **Code:** You can find the complete code for each task in their respective files.

5. **Testing:** I tested the code with different input sizes and edge cases to ensure correctness and efficiency.
