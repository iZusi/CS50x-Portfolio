# CS50x Portfolio

Welcome to my CS50x portfolio! This repository showcases my journey through Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. Below, you'll find an overview of the course structure and my contributions.

## Introduction

My name is Iyke Omozusi, and I embarked on this CS50 journey to deepen my understanding of computer science and programming. This repository serves as a record of my progress and the skills I've developed throughout the course.

## Course Structure

CS50x is divided into problem sets (Psets), lab sets (Labs) and practice problems (Practice), among other structures, each designed to challenge and expand my knowledge of various computer science concepts. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Problem Sets (Psets)

- [Pset0](./ProblemSets/Pset0): Scratch
- [Pset1](./ProblemSets/Pset1): Introduction to C programming
- [Pset2](./ProblemSets/Pset2): Arrays

### Lab Sets (Labs)

- [Lab1](./LabSets/Lab1): C programming - Population Growth
- [Lab2](./LabSets/Lab2): Arrays - Scrabble

## My Contributions

Throughout this course, I've learned valuable skills in problem-solving, algorithm design, and coding in C. I've documented my thought process and solutions in the individual README files within each problem set, lab set, and practice problem directory.

Feel free to explore my work and see how I tackled the challenges presented in the course. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect.

## How to Navigate

- Visit the [ProblemSets](./ProblemSets) directory to explore my solutions to problem sets.
- Check out the [LabSets](./LabSets) directory to see how I tackled the course labs.
- Examine the [PracticeProblems](./PracticeProblems) directory to see how I work on the course practice problems.
- Each subdirectory contains README files explaining the purpose and approach for each assignment.
