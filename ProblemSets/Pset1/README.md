# Problem Set 1 - Hello, Mario, and More

**Description:** Problem Set 1 introduces basic concepts of programming in C and includes three assignments: Hello, Mario (Pyramids), and Cash (Greedy).

**Contents:**

1. **Files:** `hello.c`, `mario-less.c`, `mario-more.c` `cash.c`

2. **Description:** This problem set focuses on building familiarity with C syntax and programming concepts. "Hello" prints a greeting message, "Mario" creates pyramid patterns, and "Cash" calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change.

3. **Approach:** I implemented functions for the Cash problem to calculate the minimum coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) for change based on predefined ranges for the input amount in cents. For the Mario (more & less) problems, the code takes user input for a pyramid height between 1 and 8 and then uses nested loops to print a pyramid pattern based on the input.

4. **Code:** You can find the complete code for each problem in their respective files.

5. **Testing:** I tested the code with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure accuracy. I also used CS50 `check50` to evaluate the correctness of my code

6. **Lessons Learned:** Problem Set 1 taught me the importance of careful planning and breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.

7. **Additional Notes:** Don't forget to check the CS50 documentation and forums for helpful resources and guidance on solving these problems.
