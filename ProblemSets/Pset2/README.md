# Problem Set 2 - Readability and Bulbs

**Description:** Problem Set 2 introduces arrays in C programming and includes two assignments: Readability and Bulbs (or Caesar, or Substitution, or Wordle50).

**Contents:**

1. **Files:** `readability.c` and `bulbs.c`

2. **Description:** This problem set focuses on building familiarity with arrays, functions, readability etc, in C. "Readability" calculates the approximate grade-level required to comprehend a given text, and "Bulb" converts each character of a user's input into binary, and represents the binary digits using emojis (dark and light) as output.

3. **Approach:** For the Readability problem, I employed three functions to count the number of letters, words, and sentences in a text. These counts are used to compute the Coleman-Liau index, a readability formula. For the Bulbs problem, I implemented a nested loop in a function to convert user-input message into binary representation and display it using dark and light emojis

4. **Code:** You can find the complete code for each problem in their respective files.

5. **Testing:** I tested the code with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure accuracy. I also used CS50 `check50` to evaluate the correctness of my code

6. **Lessons Learned:** Problem Set 2 taught me the importance of careful planning and breaking down complex problems into manageable steps. I also learned about the importance of arrays

7. **Additional Notes:** Don't forget to check the CS50 documentation and forums for helpful resources and guidance on solving these problems.
